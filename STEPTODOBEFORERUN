Got it 👍
Below is the **same guide rewritten in SIMPLE, CLEAR, PLAIN TEXT**, easy to read and follow.
No extra explanations, no guessing.

HOW TO CONNECT **PHP → FIREBASE (FIRESTORE)**
FROM ZERO UNTIL IT WORKS

---

PART 1: GET FIREBASE SERVICE ACCOUNT KEY (JSON)

Step 1: Open Firebase Console

1. Open Firebase Console in your browser
2. Select your project (example: **nyamnyam**)

Step 2: Go to Project Settings

1. Click the ⚙️ (Settings icon)
2. Click **Project settings**
3. Open the **Service accounts** tab

Step 3: Generate the key

1. Click **Generate new private key**
2. Click **Generate**
3. A `.json` file will be downloaded automatically

Example filename:

```
nyamnyam-firebase-adminsdk.json
```

Step 4: Put the JSON file into your PHP project
Move the file into a safe folder, for example:

```
config/firebase_service_account.json
```

IMPORTANT:

* Do NOT upload this file to GitHub
* Do NOT share this file

PART 2: INSTALL COMPOSER (PHP PACKAGE MANAGER)

Step 1: Check if Composer already exists
Open Command Prompt or Terminal and run:

```bash
composer --version
```

If a version number appears → Composer is installed → go to PART 3
If not → install Composer

Step 2: Install Composer (Windows)

1. Download from: [https://getcomposer.org/Composer-Setup.exe](https://getcomposer.org/Composer-Setup.exe)
2. Run the installer
3. When asked, select your `php.exe` (from XAMPP or WAMP)
4. Finish installation
5. Restart Command Prompt

Test again:

```bash
composer --version
```

---

PART 3: INSTALL FIREBASE PHP SDK
(This will create composer.json and composer.lock)

Step 1: Open your PHP project folder
Example:

```bash
cd C:\xampp\htdocs\nyamnyam
```

Step 2: Install Firebase SDK using Composer

```bash
composer require kreait/firebase-php
```

What this command does automatically:

* Creates `composer.json`
* Creates `composer.lock`
* Creates `vendor/` folder

Your project structure will now look like this:

```
nyamnyam/
│── vendor/
│── composer.json
│── composer.lock
│── config/
│   └── firebase_service_account.json
```

---

PART 4: CREATE FIREBASE CONNECTION FILE (PHP)

Create a new file called:

```
firebase.php
```

Put this code inside:

```php
<?php
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use Kreait\Firebase\Factory;

$factory = (new Factory)
    ->withServiceAccount(__DIR__ . '/config/firebase_service_account.json');

$firestore = $factory->createFirestore();
$db = $firestore->database();
```

This file:

* Loads Firebase SDK
* Connects PHP to Firestore
* Creates `$db` for database access

---

PART 5: TEST FIREBASE CONNECTION

Create another file:

```
test_firebase.php
```

Put this code inside:

```php
<?php
require 'firebase.php';

$collection = $db->collection('stall');
$documents = $collection->documents();

foreach ($documents as $doc) {
    echo $doc->id() . "<br>";
}
```

Open this URL in browser:

```
http://localhost/nyamnyam/test_firebase.php
```

If you see document IDs printed on the screen →
✅ **PHP IS CONNECTED TO FIREBASE SUCCESSFULLY**

---

COMMON MISTAKES (DO NOT DO THESE)

* Using Realtime Database URL for Firestore
* Wrong path to service account JSON
* Forgetting `vendor/autoload.php`
* Uploading service account JSON to GitHub

---

FINAL CHECKLIST (ALL MUST EXIST)

* Firebase service account JSON file
* Composer installed
* `composer.json`
* `composer.lock`
* `vendor/` folder
* `firebase.php` connection file

---

If you want next:

* PHP insert data into Firestore
* Login + approval check (`updateStatus`)
* SQL to Firebase migration
* Fix your stall owner logic

Just tell me what to do next 👍
